## Features  

### **Cricket Data Analysis**  
1. **All Teams Performance Analysis**:  
   Analyze the overall performance of all cricket teams with historical and real-time data.  
2. **Team vs Team Analysis**:  
   Compare performance metrics between two selected teams.  
3. **Team vs Team at Venue**:  
   Gain insights into how teams perform against each other at specific venues.  

### **AI-Powered Models**  
1. **Runout Detection**:  
   A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model is used to classify cricket match images into `runout` and `not runout`.  
2. **Match Prediction**:  
   A **Decision Tree** model predicts match outcomes based on historical and real-time data.  

### **Interactive Interface**  
- Django-powered dynamic dashboards for team and match analysis.  
- Easy-to-use forms for data input and model predictions.

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CAPS.git  
   cd CAPS  
   ```  

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv env  
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate  
   ```  

3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

4. Run database migrations:  
   ```bash  
   python manage.py makemigrations  
   python manage.py migrate  
   ```  

5. Train the models (optional):  
   - Place the dataset for runout detection in the `datasets/runout/` folder.  
   - Run the CNN training script:  
     ```bash  
     python models/cnn_train.py  
     ```  
   - Prepare the dataset for match predictions in `datasets/predictions/`.  
   - Run the Decision Tree training script:  
     ```bash  
     python models/dt_train.py  
     ```  

6. Start the Django development server:  
   ```bash  
   python manage.py runserver  
   ```  

7. Open the application in your browser:  
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000  
   ```
